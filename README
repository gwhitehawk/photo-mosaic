Requirements: Python, ImageMagick (I tested scripts only on Linux)

Usage: 
Edit mosaic.sh: 
PATH_TO_PIC=[ name of your photo directory ]
RESULT=[ name of the resulting mosaic file ]

Source text file format example:
pic1 pic2
pic3 

In the resulting mosaic, 2 photos will be in the first row, one in the second row.

Run:
./mosaic.sh [source text file] [final picture width] [ picture border (=space between photos and around them) ]

Todo: GUI, choice between custom and optimized tiling
